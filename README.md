# connective-plugin-linux

A replacement for the Connective Browser Plugin which is used on several websites to log in or sign documents using a card reader and an electronic identity card. There is only official support for Windows and Mac, so this application is primarily focused on Linux support.
Please note the distinction with the Connective SignID Software, this is not supported in this repository.

## Limitations

This application is tested with a [VASCO Digipass 870](https://www.onespan.com/products/card-readers/digipass-870), which has a keypad, and an [Alcor Micro AU9560](https://www.alcorlink.com/product-AU9560-USB.html) (sold under the Mya brand) without keypad. It should work as well for any other card reader supported by Linux.

At the moment there is only support for Belgian electronic identity cards. You're welcome to create a pull request to add support for other cards but keep in mind I am unable to test this before merging.

There is also one security feature which is not implemented, because the algorithm is unknown. Whether this [security through obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) feature is really improving the security or not is debatable, but you should be aware that your personal data may be sent to anyone on the internet when using this application.

Although this never happened during testing, there were reports that the pincode was requested a second time before it was entered the first time. If this happens to you it requires hitting the ok button twice on the cardreader.

## Alternative

You can find an alternative solution in the client-server directory. With this solution the browser plugin is installed in Linux, but all commands to the backend are sent over the network to a Windows machine where you should connect the card reader.

There are obvious disadvantages with this solution. First of all your identity is transferred unencrypted over the network, which may be visible by anyone, but apart from that you will have to walk from one computer to another while logging in.

The advantage is that all hardware and all security features are supported, since the official backend is used. It was implemented with the intention to run the backend under [wine](https://www.winehq.org/), but unfortunately wine has incomplete support for smartcards.

You may still opt to use this solution if you can run Windows in a virtual machine. See the README.md file in the client-server directory for installation instructions.

## Requirements

The backend runs under Python, but you need to have a few modules installed:
- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to display messageboxes and dialogs while signing.
- [pyscard](https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/pyscard) to communicate with the card reader.
- [nativemessaging](https://github.com/Rayquaza01/nativemessaging) to install the backend, but this is not mandatory to run the code. If you know how to install the manifest for native messaging applications you can skip this requirement.

## Installation

### Obtaining the plugin

Trying to install the Connective browser package under Linux results in a message `This operating system is not supported`. You are not even able to download anything.

To obtain the necessary files anyway run the `get_connective_plugin.py` script included in this repository. A subdirectory `connective-downloads` will be created, containing the installer for both the browser plugin and the windows native application. The native application is only required for the client-server alternative solution.

### Installing the browser plugin

This should be straightforward. Go to the `connective-downloads` directory created in the previous step, open `connective_signing_extension-1.0.4.xpi` in your web browser and follow the installation instructions.

### Installing the backend

This script will be started by your browser whenever the Connective Browser Plugin receives the command to do so and provides the functionality to use the card reader.

Install the nativemessaging package (`pip install nativemessaging`) and run `nativemessaging-install.py firefox` or `nativemessaging-install.py chrome` depending on your browser. This will install a modified version of `native-manifest.json` in your browser's configuration, containing the full path to `connective-backend.py`. Keep this in mind when you want to move the backend to another location, you will need to re-run `nativemessaging-install.py` with the appropriate parameter in that case.

## Troubleshooting

Refer to the README.md file in the test directory for detailed information on how to verify your installation and where to find error messages.
